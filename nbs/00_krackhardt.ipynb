    "The graph hierarchy condition states that in a digraph D, for each pair of points where one (Pi) can reach another (Pj), the second (Pj) can't reach the first (Pi). \n",

    "To measure the degree of hierarchy of digraph D, a new digraph Dr must be created. Dr is defined as the reachability digraph of D. Each point in D exists in Dr; moreover, the line (Pi,Pj) exists in Dr if and only if Pi can reach Pj in D. If D is graph hierarchic, then Dr will have no symmetric lines in it (i.e. if the line (Pi,Pj) exists in Dr then the line (Pj,Pi) does not).\n",
